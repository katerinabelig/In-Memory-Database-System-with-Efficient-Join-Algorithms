## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main parts:

## Part 1: Implementation of Equality Join Operator
This part focuses on implementing the fundamental relational operator, the equality join. The implementation is designed to handle data stored in memory using columnar storage for efficiency. The objective is to create a join operation that can efficiently combine rows from two tables based on a common column.

## Part 2: Implementation of Join and Filter in Complex Queries
The second part expands on the concepts from the first part by introducing complex query processing capabilities. This includes handling multiple tables with various columns, performing joins, and applying filters to the queries. The implementation is based on the query processing challenges from the SIGMOD 2018 programming competition.
